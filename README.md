# Restaurent-Web-Application
The Restaurant website application offers menu from the different real-time restaurants in which data is in the form of HTML as in website and PDF format. I use crawler to crawl the website data and have done parsing with the pdf file menu . This website communicate with database through REST-API and displays the content in front-end. In front â€“end , we are able to search by restaurant name , dishes and ingredient of the dish. In addition, We are updating the menu by triggering the crawler from interface. Also we use event handler and AJAX interaction for front-end web development
